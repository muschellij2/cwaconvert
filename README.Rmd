The goal of `read.cwa` is to provide functionality to convert 'Axivity' 'CWA' files (https://axivity.com/).  The data was extracted from https://github.com/digitalinteraction/openmovement/, specifically code from https://github.com/digitalinteraction/openmovement/tree/master/Software/AX3/cwa-convert/c, 
which has the following copyright:

## Installation

You can install the released version of `read.cwa` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```r

```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/read.cwa")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to read in a CWA file:

```{r example}
library(read.cwa)
file = system.file("extdata", "ax3_testfile.cwa.gz", package = "read.cwa")
out = read_cwa(file)
head(out)
```

```{r ex2}
out = read_cwa(file, xyz_only = TRUE)
head(out)
## basic example code
```
